	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient <br>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> O(n), <br>Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. And O stands for Order Of , so O(N) is read “Order of N” — it is an approximation of the duration of the algorithm given N input elements</p>
